Alex Vincent's personal living boilerplate for production-grade hybrid React apps.

Current Tech Stack:

- Yarn
- TypeScript
- React
- Husky
- Webpack (Client / Dev Server & Productionized Builds)
- React Router (DOM)
- SASS
- ESLint (and typescript-eslint)
- Prettier
- Stylelint
- Babel
- Jest
- Normalize.css
- Manifest best practices (optimized mobile icons)
- Custom fonts / font-face
- Developer tooling (Auto-generated components, routes, unit-tests)

# TO-DO: (In Order)

# TO-DO: 2. Add code splitting for custom code modules, routes, css

# TO-DO: 3. Add Figma / Storybook

# TO-DO 4. Add an API library

# TO-DO: 5. Add an automated testing framework support (Cypress / Playwright)

# TO-DO: 6. Set up NGINX

# TO-DO: 7. Set up Dockerfile

# TO-DO: 8. Manually deploy to Heroku

# TO-DO: 9. Automate deployments using CircleCI

# ---------- Come Back To / TO-DOs -------

# TO-DO: Add performance insights (Lighthouse / performance budget). Lighthouse node CLI doesn't work on localhost

# so we'll need to find a way to test it when we can get environments up. Ideally I would like some kind of yarn command

# I could run to get a Lighthouse report, but that doesn't exist right now. We'll also be doing Performance Budgeting through

# Lighthouse as well when this works.

# TO-DO: Critical CSS rendering (the process of putting above the fold css in the head as a static style tag) seems to be

# an optimization that requires a bit of maintenance (aka there isn't any clearly nice tooling that doesn't come with lots of

# overhead). The advice is to implement it only when it becomes an issue.

# TO-DO Fix @ts-ignores
